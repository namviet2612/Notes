File Permission in Linux

1. Understanding and Using file permission
-> Everything is a file: directories, files, devices
-> Super user "root" has the ability to access to any file of the system
-> Permissions are referred as bits
    Permission      Action      chmod option
    read            (view)      r or 4
    write           (edit)      w or 2
    execute         (execute)   x or 1
-> Three types of user restrictions
    User        ls output
    owner       -rwx------
    group       ----rwx---
    other       -------rwx
-> The restriction is not inheritable: the file owner will be unaffected by
restriction of his group or others

2. Folder/Directory Permissions
    Permission      Action                                  chmod option
    read            (view content, i.e. ls command)         r or 4
    write           (create or remove files from dir)       w or 2
    execute         (cd into directory)                     filx or 1
