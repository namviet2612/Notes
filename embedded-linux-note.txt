PART1: INTRODUCTION
1. What is embedded linux?
Embedded Linux is the combination of Linux kernel and various open-source
components of embedded system
2. Advantages:
- Re-using components
- Low cost
- Full control
- Quality assurance and tested from community
- Eases testing of new features
3. Embedded hardware:
- Wide range of architecture:
    + x86 and x86-64 of PC platforms and other embedded system
    + ARM
    + PowerPC
    + MIPS (in networking embedded system)
    ...
- Processor and architecture:
    + MMU = Memory management unit
    + Linux are not designed for small microcontrollers
    + Beside the toolchain, the bootloader and the kernel, all other components
    are generally architecture-independent
- RAM and storage
    + RAM: 32 MB at least,sometimes 8MB with tiny system
    + Storage: 4MB is required, but usually more is needed
- Communication
    + Many common communication (I2C, CAN, SPI, ...) and extensive networking (
    ETH, Wifi, Bluetooth,...) are supported
4. Embedded Linux system architecture
- Software component
    + Cross-compilation toolchain: compiler that runs on the development-host,
    but generates code for the target
    + Bootloader: Started by the hardware, basic initialization, loading and
    executing Linux kernel
    + Linux Kernel: Contain the device drivers, process and memories management,
    stack, network drivers, services
    + C library: The interface between the kernel and the user space application
    + Libraries or applications
5. Software packages:
- Linux distribution provides a way to install, update and uninstall application
and libraries: packages
- .deb on Debian and Ubuntu, .rpm on Red Hat, Fedora
- Packages are stored in repositories, HTTP or FTP servers.
- Managing:
    + Repositories stored in /etc/apt/sources.list
    + sudo apt-get update
    + apt-cache search <keyword>: to find a package to install
    + sudo apt-get install <package>
    + sudo apt-get remove <package>
    + sudo apt-get dist-upgrade: install all available package updates
    + apt-cache show <package>: get info about a package
6. Host vs target
- Host is the development workstation, typically a powerful PC
- Target is the embedded system under development
- Connection: serial line for debugging, Ethernet, JTAG interface
- Tools: picocom, putty, ...

PART2: CROSS-COMPILING TOOLCHAINS
1. Definition:
- Run on your workstation, but generate code for your target
2. Machines in build procedures:
- 3 types in total:
    + The build machine: where the toolchain is built
    + The host machine: where the toolchain will be executed
    + The target machine: where the binaries created by the toolchain are
    executed
- 4 common build types:
    + Native build: build, host and target on same workstation
    + Cross build: build, host is workstation, target is the embedded system
    (the most common case)
    + Cross-native build: build is workstation, host and target is the embedded
    system
    + Canadian build: build on A, host on B, target on C
3. Binutils:
- Is a set of tools to generate and manipulate binaries for a given CPU
architecture
    + as: the assembler, generates binary code for assembler source code
    + ld: the linker
    + ar, ranlib: to generate .a archives, used for libraries
    + objdump, readelf, size, nm, strings: to inspect binaries
    + strip: to strip parts of binaries that just needed for debugging
4. Kernel header:
- The C library and compiled programs need to interact with the kernel
    + Available system calls and their numbers
    + Constant definitions
    + Data structures, etc.
- Therefore, compiling the C library requires kernel header
- Available in <linux/...> and <asm/...> and a few other directories
5. C/C++ compiler:
- GCC: GNU Compiler Collection
6. C library
- Interface between the application and the kernel
- Provides the well-known standard C API to ease application development
- Several C libraries: glibc, uClibc, musl,...
6.1 glibc
- C library for the GNU project
- Quite big for small embedded systems.
6.2 uClibc-ng
- Continuation of the old uClibc project
- Lightweight C library for small embedded systems
6.3 musl C
- Lightweight, fast and simple library for embedded systems
7. Toolchain options
7.1 ABI:
- ABI: Application Binary Interface, defines the calling conventions (how
function argument are passed, how system calls are made,..) and the organization
of a structure
- On ARM, two main ABI: EABI and OABI
- On MIPS, several ABIs: o32, o64, n32, n64
7.2 Floating point support
- For processors have floating point unit, the toolchain generate hard float
code, in order to use floating point instructions directly
- For processors without floating point unit, two solutions:
+ Generate hard float code and the kernel will emulate the floating point
instructions.
+ Generate soft float code, calls to user space library
7.3 CPU optimization flags:
- A set of cross-compiling tools is specific to a CPU architecture (ARM, x86,
PowerPC, MIPS)
- Some further options:
+ -march allows to select a specific target instruction set
+ -mtune allows to optimize code for a specific CPU
8. Obtain a toolchain:
- Build a toolchain manually is diffcult and painful.
-> Solution: get a pre-compiled toolchain
- Make sure the toolchain meet the reqs
- Many root build systems allow the cross-compiling toolchain: buildroot,
PTXdists, OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project
- Another solution is to use utilities that automate the process of toolchain
building
+ Advantages: be like pre-compiled toolchain, don't need to mess up with all the
details of the build process, more flexibility in terms of toolchain
configuration, contain several patches that fix known issues
+ Crosstool-ng: https://crosstool-ng.github.io/
9. Toolchain contents:
- The cross compiling toolchain binaries, in bin/. The directory should be added
to your PATH for easy usage
- One or several sysroot, each contain the C libraries and related libraries, C
library headers and kernel headers

PART3: BOOTLOADER
1. Boot sequence:
The bootloader is a piece of code responsible for:
- Basic HW initialization
- Loading of an application binary, usually an operating system kernel
- Possibly decompression of the application binary
- Execution of application binary
