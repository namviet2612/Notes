SQL noted

1. Introduction
SQL stand for Structure Query Language -> let you access and manipulate
databases

RDBMS stand for Relational Database Management System, is the basis for SQL, and
for all modern database systems: MS SQL Server, MySQL, Microsoft Access

Tables: is the place where data stored, has columns and rows

Column: represent a field in a table

Row: represent a record in a table

2. SQL syntax
SQL is not case sensitive

Some of the most important SQL commands

SELECT: extracts data from a database
UPDATE: update data in a database
DELETE: deletes data from a database
INSERT INFO: insert new data in to a database
CREATE DATABASE: create a new database
ALTER DATABASE: modifies a database
DROP DATABASE: deletes a table
CREATE INDEX: creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX: deletes an index

3.SQL Select

Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;

In case of select all data in table:
SELECT * FROM table_name;

SELECT DISTINCT is used to only display distinct (different) values

Syntax: SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name

Ex: SELECT * FROM CustomersTable //Extract all the data of CustomersTable
    SELECT CustomerName, CustomerPhone FROM CustomersTable

4.SQL Where
WHERE is used to filter record, extract the records fulfilled the requirement

Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;

Ex: SELECT * FROM CustomersTable WHERE CustomerID = 1

5.SQL And, Or, Not
These keywords are used for condition when using Where

6.SQL Order By
ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result in ascending or descending
Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
        ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC

ASC: ascending
DESC: descending

7. SQL Insert Into

Syntax: INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
        VALUES ('value_of_c1', 'value_of_c2', ...);

In some tables, the ID will auto-increment and not necessary to add to the command

If there is missing additional value of a field, the 'null' will be fill

Ex: INSERT INTO CustomersTable (CustomerName, CustomerPhone, CustomerAddress)
    VALUES ('Nam', '82108403', 'Hanoi')

8. What is a NULL value

A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. NULL value is different
from zero, or a field that contain space: A field with a NULL value is left
blank during record creation

9. SQL Update Statement

Syntax: UPDATE table_name
        SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
        WHERE condition;

If missing WHERE clause, the whole table will be updated

10. SQL Delete

Syntax: DELETE FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;

If missing WHERE clause, the whole table will be deleted

11. SQL Select Top, Limit or Rownum
Extract the data with the specific number of records

11.1 SQL Select Top (SQL Server, MS Access)

Syntax: SELECT TOP number_of_top|percent column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;

11.2 SQL Limit (mySQL)

Syntax: SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition
        LIMIT number;

11.3 SQL Rownum (Oracle)

Syntax: SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition AND ROWNUM < number

12. SQL Like and Wildcards

Syntax: SELECT column_name(s) 
	FROM table_name
	WHERE col_n LIKE condition

Ex: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID LIKE '1%'

-> FInd all the records with CustomerID start with 1

Wildcards:
	'_' represent whatever character
	'%' represent zero or none character

-> '1%' : Find the values with first character as 1
-> '1_' : Find the values with 2 characters, first character as 1
-> '%1% : Find the values with number 1 appear anywhere
-> '_1_': Find the values with 3 characters, the number 1 in 2nd position
